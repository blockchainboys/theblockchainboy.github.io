**"Give a corrupt man a gun and he can rob a bank...but give a corrupt man a bank**
**and he can rob the world."** -Blockchain Boy

The 2007 and 1970's financial crisis could have been avoided with Blockchain.  Data mining of transactions would of revealed loans were not being paid back. Data mining would of revealed lies on income reporting. Changes in title ownership would have being easier to research. The tracking of transactions would have made it easier to find the unethical behavior at rating agencies, the unethical behavior by mortgage brokers, the unethical behavior at real estate companies, the crimminal behavior at mortgage companies, the unethical behavior of government employees and the unethical behavior at banks. I am quite pleased to see the Fintech community embrace Blockchain.  There are a lot of good people working in financial services and government they just need better tools. Maybe it will be the financial firms that help the government replace FIAT with a fully tracked currency that absolutely no one can manipulate, corrupt or use to hide crime.
I am not saying Blockchain is the solution to all of our socio-economic problems, but is is start.  Blockchain should only be applied in cases where you need immutable transactions, a distributed network (for security etc.) and ledger. If you need to frequently modify the data stored on the blockchain it is not a good solution.  Blockchain is not a silver bullet but it is a tool that can help disrupt a  system controlled by one corrupt entity and replace it with a system that solves the trust problem via a large number of voting nodes.
