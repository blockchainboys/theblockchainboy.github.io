title: Cryptocurrency A Shady Business

We all know there is great potential in Cryptocurrency but let's face it our industry is so sleazy 
even the crack dealers are scared.  It is the sleaze factor that is hurting prices and destroying
potential.  Just look at these two lists of hacks and scams:


[Blockchain Hacks](https://magoo.github.io/Blockchain-Graveyard/)

[Fake Coins](https://deadcoins.com/)

We have fake coins, drugs, ICO fraud, bitconnect, bribery of governments and a massive frenzy
of mother @%$#%$ out to scam the public as fast and as hard as they can.

I remember this quote from wolves of wall street.

"First we pitch them the  blue chip stocks,  the stocks these  people already know...once we sucker
 them in, we sell them the dogshit"
-Jordan Belfort

When I look at some of the new coin fund offerings, I have my own version:

"First we get them into the cyrptos that these people already know Ethereum/Bitcoin, once we sucker them in, we pitch them the dogshit alt coins"

**In fact if an  ICO or cryptocurrency  website  starts off with the words  "We believe in helping"  it is
probably a scam.**  

Right now we need:

*Security

*Accountability

*A way for the lower class to take part in this wealth creation

*Governance

*Clarity

*Fairness

*Speedy regulation

*Speedy resolution

*Faster Transactions and currency stablization

*A few acceptable laws

As engineers that work with this technology we need to be like the scientists in Germany who **refused** 
to make poison gas. We need to be able to state:

"No I don't want your money if there is blood on it" 

There are a lot of honest people working in Cryptocurrency and Blockchain **but we are all suffering
due to the overwhelming stench of scumbags**.
