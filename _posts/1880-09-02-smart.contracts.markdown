 My hero Vitalik Buterin, the 22-year-old programmer of Ethereum, explained what a smart contract is:

 "In a smart contract approach, an asset or currency is transferred into a program “and the program
  runs this code and at some point it automatically validates a condition and it automatically determines
  whether the asset should go to one person or back to the other person, or whether it should be immediately
  refunded to the person who sent it or some combination thereof.”In the meantime, the decentralized ledger
  also stores and replicates the document which gives it a certain security and immutability."

 People that want more transparency and integrity in their transactions are jumping for joy. One
 example of this is in fractional co-ownership of commercial property. Smart Contracts are used
 to make ownership percentages of a property (like a new hotel project) transparent. When the property is
 sold profits are distrubuted via the execution of a smart contract that pays out the profits according
 to the percentage of investment. The contract is immutable so the investor is secure in the
 knowledge that the contract is safe from corruption and unfair modification.
