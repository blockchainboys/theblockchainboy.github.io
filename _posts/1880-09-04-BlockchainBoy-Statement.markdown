I built this website to provide educational and insightful articles on Blockchain technology. Now that the hype over bitcoin has
died down a bit we can take off our party hats and get to work building the future. I will provide technical advice not investment advice. Yes I was early to the Crypto investment market but only because I was interested in understanding the underlying technology. I have found if you tell someone to buy an investment you also need to remind them when to sell. A responsible financial advisor creates a loop or has a system that automatically sells when certain triggers take place. If you tell someone to buy as a favor, you also need to tell that someone when to sell and I don't want that type of long term commitment.

In physics and business there are no hitching posts.  You should not expect crypto currency to have a 
hitching post either. Crypto currency is very dynamic and you to need to keep up with news and latest technology.
This blog will help you keep up.
