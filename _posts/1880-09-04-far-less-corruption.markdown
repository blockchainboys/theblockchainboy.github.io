**"Give a corrupt man a gun and he can rob a bank...but give a corrupt man a bank**
**and he can rob the world."** -Blockchain Boy

The 2007 and 1970's financial crisis could have been avoided with Blockchain.  Data mining of transactions would of revealed loans were not being paid back. Data mining would of revealed lies on income reporting. Changes in title ownership would have being easier to research. The tracking of transactions would have made it easier to find the unethical behavior at rating agencies, the unethical behavior at mortgage brokers, the unethical behavior at real estate companies, the unethical behavior at mortgage companies, the unethical behavior of government employees and the unethical behavior at banks. I am quite pleased to see the Fintech community embrace Blockchain.  There are a lot of good people working in financial services and government they just need better tools.
